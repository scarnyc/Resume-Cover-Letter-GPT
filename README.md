## OpenAI Assistants API
I created the assistant by using the OpenAI Assistants API via the OpenAI Python SDK. For compute, I used DataCamp workspaces -> you can find the same notebook that's in the repo here: https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/5f4500bd-cd2b-4466-8c28-e1222f97523a

## Playground UI
After I created the assistant, I'm able to chat with it via the OpenAI Playground, as seen in the image above.

What I\\'ve done is I\\'ve tailored your resume to better align with the requirements and responsibilities outlined in the job description for the Principal Product Manager, Conversational AI Platform position at ServiceNow.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of how I made these changes:\\n\\n1. **Role Titling and Focus**: I\\'ve rebranded some of your previous job titles to more closely match the language used in the job description from ServiceNow. For example, from \"Sr. Manager, AI Product Lead\" to \"Principal AI Product Manager.\" This immediately signals to the hiring manager that you have held high-level positions with responsibilities similar to those of the role you\\'re applying for.\\n\\n2. **Highlighting Relevant Experience**: I emphasized aspects of your previous roles that are particularly relevant to the job description, such as leading AI product strategies, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and conducting market research, to demonstrate your capability to define and execute product roadmaps for conversational AI platforms.\\n\\n3. **Quantifying Achievements**: In some bullet points, I\\'ve quantified your achievements (like the $5M in cost savings at Verizon and the $24M in additional revenue at Healthfirst), which helps to measure the impact you\\'ve had in your roles and suggests the value you could provide to ServiceNow.\\n\\n4. **Matching Skills to Job Specifications**: I\\'ve rephrased and reordered skills and experiences to mirror the requirements listed in the job description. This includes emphasizing your technical background, experience with Agile methodologies, and your knowledge of conversational and generative AI, as these were all mentioned as key qualifications.\\n\\n5. **Providing Evidence of Skills**: Where possible, I\\'ve linked the skills you listed with specific, concrete examples from your experience, such as developing an NLP platform or leading the transition to an AI-powered recommendation system at Grubhub. This not only shows you have the skills but also that you\\'ve applied them successfully in real-world scenarios.\\n\\nThe goal is to make it clear to the hiring manager at ServiceNow that your past experiences and skills make you a strong fit for the position you want. By reflecting the language and requirements of the job description in your resume, you\\'re more likely to get past initial screenings and be considered for an interview.\\n\\nOne thing to keep in mind is the use of terms and concepts that are directly related to the new position. For example, mentioning \"Large Language Models (LLMs),\" \"ethical AI considerations,\" and \"prompt engineering\" shows familiarity with advanced AI concepts which are important for this particular Principal Product Manager role.\\n\\nLet me know if you need any further assistance, such as creating a cover letter or additional tailoring of your resume details.'},\n     'type': 'text'}],\n   'created_at': 1704040142,\n   'file_ids': [],\n   'metadata': {},\n   'object': 'thread.message',\n   'role': 'assistant',\n   'run_id': 'run_llGqvj0RFwIAZobKdUbenuTh',\n   'thread_id': 'thread_yc6SIWZ5ygvdBuPGApKruUh0'}],\n 'object': 'list',\n 'first_id': 'msg_ekfTvNtHBo61CYMMR0ZfXox5',\n 'last_id': 'msg_ekfTvNtHBo61CYMMR0ZfXox5',\n 'has_more': False}"},"metadata":{}}]},{"source":"## Message annotations\nMessages created by Assistants may contain annotations within the content array of the object.
